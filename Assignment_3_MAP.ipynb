    "### Reflection\n",
    "While it was quite helpful to view the metadata output files in gaining an understanding how the various fields appeared in the records, it was hard to gain a clear understanding of what fields would be present in all records. I was uncertain as to how I could compile all of the information together from the different json files, so I picked a few different ones to look at that I hope were representative. Some fields I am near certain would show up in every item, such as title, format, and catalog record link. I have marked the LCCN as mandatory as I would hope that in a Library of Congress collection all entries would have one, but without checking file or developing a script to print the fields, I cannot say for certain. While probably not the best practice to keep it marked as mandatory, I have included this uncertainty in the Notes column. While a lengthy process and for the sake of finishing this in a vaguely timely manner I had to lessen my critical analysis of the fields, I did have fun figuring out the best fields for the information I wanted to display. The majority of my summer internship was something similar to this (without the TAP) and I spent a month and a half creating clear and specific guidelines for crosswalking between the fields of the collection, DublinCore, and PBCore. I enjoy working through it as an intellectual pursuit and found it quite fun. I try to avoid losing information when crosswalking and making this a bit unspecific so I enjoy finding the specific MODS elements that will allow me to retain more information than DublinCore. I also enjoyed figuring out how to create the TAP csv as I wanted to try something new rather than an endless amount of tables (which is a little hard to make in markdown)."
